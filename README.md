This Project was done by a group of 3 that was tasked to make a any type of website and we chose to make a e-commerce website that would sell our university's clothing.
What is not completly finished was our checkout page since the project was a 2 week long project and we were running out of time on completing some minor details. However
all the functions that our group wanted to implement is in the website such as adding, editing, as well as deleting products.
